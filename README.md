# Fashion MNIST Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained using PyTorch and achieves over **85% accuracy** on the validation dataset.

---

## Objective
- Build a CNN using PyTorch.
- Train and validate the model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Visualize model performance with accuracy and cost (loss) plots.
- Display sample predictions from the validation dataset.

---

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST (from torchvision)
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Color**: Grayscale
- **Classes**: 10 categories including T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot
